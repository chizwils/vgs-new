					<h3 class="sub-header ">Declining Profitability Analysis and Solutions Implementation</h3>
					<p>We offer a top down approach to an operator's declining profitability problem. Why is your profit declining? What revenue stream is affected? Is it tied to a general gaming market behavior or trend? Are your operational costs increasing? Are you experiencing a declining volume of bets placed on your platform? Why? Or maybe there is no decline, but you want to increase your profits? A VGS analysis encompasses all aspects of the problem or goal. <br><br>
						We collate all relevant data, identify the possible causes, and propose long lasting solutions through qualitative and quantitative methods.

How can you acquire and retain more punters? How can you position your brand as the go-to online betting platform for punters?

We build financial models by collating data and calculating key economic indicators like NPV, VIR, PB, UTC, etc in order to give our clients the cashflows, revenues, and profits on a project over a time period, discounted to the present value of money. We make projections with different sensitivities on vigorish, number of punters, daily betting/gaming behaviors, etc. We also analyze and compare different project options, and advise our clients on which is a more profitable investment option.
